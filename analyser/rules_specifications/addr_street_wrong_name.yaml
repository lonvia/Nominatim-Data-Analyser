                description: The addr:street tag does not match the name of the street the address was assigned to.
                why_problem: The addr:street tag should have exactly the same name as the street.
                how_to_fix: |
                  Check if there is a typo in the addr:street tag or
                  in the name of the street. Another possible cause for this
                  error: the address is part of an associatedStreet relation
                  that has an error.
